## HTML & CSS

The browser parses the HTML document and builds a tree of elements, called the `document object model` (DOM).

The browser then uses the DOM to render the page.

Additionally, it uses the `cascading style sheets` (CSS) to style the elements.

HTML and CSS can refer to external resources like images, stylesheets, scripts and more that are loaded by the browser with additional requests.

## JavaScript

To run code on the client, the browser can execute `JavaScript` (JS) and `WebAssembly` (WASM).

JS is a scripting language that can be used to manipulate the DOM and to make requests to APIs to load additional data.

WASM is a fairly new technology that allows to run compiled code in the browser.

JS is still the most common way to run code on the client.
