## Node Package Manager

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a JavaScript runtime that allows to run JavaScript outside of the browser.
In addition to this usefull feature, it also comes with an important ecosystem for all kinds of JavaScript projects.

The [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com) (NPM) is a package manager that allows to install and manage dependencies for JavaScript projects.

The possibility to depend on external packages is a key feature of development.
It allows to reuse code and to build on top of other projects.
This also makes it easy to share abstract modules in internal projects.

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

To use npm we need to install Node.js.
