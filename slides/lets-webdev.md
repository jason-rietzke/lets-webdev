## Prerequisites

To getting started with web development, make sure you have the following tools installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com)

Node.js comes with the Node Package Manager (NPM) which is used to install and manage dependencies for JavaScript projects.

Visual Studio Code is a code editor that is used to write code and to manage projects.

Git is a version control system that is used to manage the source code of projects.

It is also advantageous to have a GitHub account as a means to manage your projects with Git.

## Setup with Vite

To get started with a new project, create a new directory (or clone an existing project from GitHub) and run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest .
```

This creates the basic structure of a new web application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

The CLI tool will ask you to choose a framework and a language. 
For this introduction, we are going with `Vanilla` and `TypeScript`.

Afterwards, you can install the dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
